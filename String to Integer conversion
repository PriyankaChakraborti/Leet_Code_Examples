# Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer.

# The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.

# The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.

# If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.

# If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned.

# Note:

#     Only the space character ' ' is considered as whitespace character.
#     Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. If the numerical value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (231 − 1) or INT_MIN (−231) is returned.
